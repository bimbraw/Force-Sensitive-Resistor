# Force Sensitive Resistor
Code for calibrated FSR on an Arduino Uno.

FSR dimensions - 

Length - 56.77mm/2.35in
Width - 18.48mm/0.73in
Thickness - 0.55mm/0.02in
Weight - 0.26g/0.01oz

Tested on both Uno and Mega. Terminals connected according to https://learn.adafruit.com/force-sensitive-resistor-fsr/using-an-fsr!

Used a 3.3kOhm resistor.

Used for force testing on Shimon Robot to spec out the new actuators.

And for the Sitar Input project - for Technology Ensemble.
